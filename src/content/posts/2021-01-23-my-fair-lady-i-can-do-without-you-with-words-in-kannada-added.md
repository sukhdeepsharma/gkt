I can do without you! with some words in Kannada added in Latin script in blue.

George Bernard Shaw was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1925. He wrote the play ‘Pygmalion’ in 1912. The film ‘My Fair Lady’ is an adaptation of this play. Reluctantly, he agreed to the different ending in the film. In the play, the male tyrannical teacher Prof. Henry Higgins is inconsiderate and thoughtless with the extraordinarily hard working flower girl Eliza Doolittle. Higgins’ mother is kind and fair to the good girl. Eliza Doolittle emerges as an empowered woman.

What a fool I was, what a dominated fool
To think that you were the earth and the sky
What a fool I was
What an addlepated fool
What a muddle-headed dolt was I!
No, my reverberated friend
You are not the beginning and the end
There'll be spring every year without you
Bharatha still will be here without you
Birds will chirp without you
Elephants will trumpet without you
Thenginamara, Arlimara and Aaladamara will grow without you.
Mallige, Sampige, Shavantige,
Thusli, Thale, and Thavare will bloom without you
I can do without you
There'll be fruit on the tree and a shore by the sea
There’ll be Balehannu, Mavinahanu, and Halasinahannu without you
I can do without you

There’ll be Seekarne, Gulpavte and Aambade without you
There'll be Uppittu and Hurittu without you
There'll be Obbattu and Dumrotu without you
There'll be Thambittu and Avarekalu Thalipittu without you
I can do without you

There’ll be Seere and Odave without you

There’ll be Aata and Paatha without you

I can do without you

Art and music will thrive without you

Ravi Verma will survive without you

Ravindranath Tagore will survive without you

And there still will be rain without you

I can do without you

They can still rule the land without you

Himalaya Mountains will stand without you

Ganga River will flow without youAnd without much ado we can all muddle through without you

Without your pulling it, the tide comes in

Without your twirling it, the earth can spin

Without your pushing them, the clouds roll by

Without your lifting them, the Sun and the Moon rise

If they can do without you, ducky, so can IThere’ll be Gandha and Manthra without you

There’ll be Pooja and Homa without you

There’ll be Gowri and Ganesha without you

There’ll be Durgi and Lakshmi without you

I can do without youI will have my work without you

I will have my hobbies without you

There’ll be People who Love me without you

I shall not feel alone without you

I can stand on my own without you

So go back in your shell

I can do very well without you!
