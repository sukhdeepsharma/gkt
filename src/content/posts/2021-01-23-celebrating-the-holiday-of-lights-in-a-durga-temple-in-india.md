The Shri Durga Adishakthi Temple honoring the Hindu goddess Durga is a very short walk away from where I’m staying in Udupi, India. I happened to walk past it on December 14th during my daily walk and noticed that they were placing A TON of candles in different formations all around the temple. The priest came out and invited me to come to the celebration at 7:00pm. I didn’t think I would make it due to other plans, but things worked out otherwise and it ended up being one of my top experiences here in India. Simply incredible! As I arrived, the priest introduced me to one of the local community women who became my guide and took me through the back of the temple to another temple that I didn’t even know was there! This one was for Naga, the Hindu snake god. Naga, (Sanskrit: “serpent”) in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, a member of a class of mythical semidivine beings, half human and half cobra. They are a strong, handsome species who can assume either wholly human or wholly serpentine form and are potentially dangerous but often beneficial to humans. ~ Britannica The musicians started playing and the celebration began. The priest did prayers and offerings to Naga as everyone watched.
