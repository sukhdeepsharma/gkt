EFFECTIVE CURSE

Indian Queen Alamelamma, in 1610, uttered three effective curses. There was a very strong basis for her to curse.

“May Thalakadu become a barren land,

May Malangi turn into a whirlpool,

May Mysuru kings not have children (for all time to come).”

Alamelamma, with her husband King Thirumala II \[a real king] lived in the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire, Srirangapatna, an island in the river Kaveri in now Karnataka state in southern India.

In Srirangapatna there is an ancient Ranganathaswamy Temple, a Vishnu temple. There is also an idol of Ranganathaswamy’s wife, Ranganayaki. Alamelamma was a great devotee of the Goddess Ranganayaki. On Tuesdays and Fridays, she sent her personal jewels to the temple to adorn the deity. `

Neighboring king Wadiyar of Mysuru, a real king \[unlike later titular kings of his dynasty], kept challenging King Thirumala II and grabbing parts of the latter’s kingdom. Finally, King Thirumala II relinquished his kingdom to Wadiyar. King Thirumala II and Alamelamma, with her jewels, retired to the latter’s home town of Malangi down the Kaveri river.

Alamelamma’s husband, King Thirumala II, fell sick. Knowledgeable persons advised him to hold prayer services for several days in Thalakadu across the Kaveri river, in a Shiva Temple by name Vaidyeshwara temple – Vaidya means physician. However, after three days of prayer services, he passed away.

The young Alamelamma who had already lost her kingdom, now lost her husband. Having been married for a short time, she did not have children.

The greedy Mysuru king Wadiyar had already grabbed pious Alamelamma’s kingdom. Eyeing her jewelry, he sent his soldiers to obtain from her, her jewels. She parted with a single jewel, a giant pearl nose ring. That was not enough for Wadiyar. Then he sent armed male soldiers to forcibly get all the jewels from unarmed Alamelamma.

Upon getting wind of armed male soldiers pursuing her, with her jewels, she quickly climbed a cliff and jumped off into the whirlpool in the Kaveri river. It was the year 1610. She uttered three curses:

“May Thalakadu become a barren land,

May Malangi turn into a whirlpool

May Mysuru kings not have children (for all time to come)”

At the time of the curse, Wadiyar had four sons. Soon after the curse, three of his sons including the eldest son, died. Bereaved, he retired to Melkote a town known for Vishnu devotees. His deceased eldest son’s son was crowned king. This king did not have sons. He adopted the sole living son of his father, that is, his own paternal uncle. This paternal uncle king was assassinated in a year. That ended the blood line of the greedy Wadiyar king who had grabbed Alamelamma’s kingdom and her giant pearl nose ring and eyed the rest of her jewelry.

#### **THREE EFFECTS OF THE CURSE**

![Lord Vishnu Temple under the sand dunes in Thalakadu, Karnataka. Now the government is trying to excavate the ancient city.

1. Once upon a time Thalakadu had been the capital of different empires. There were over 30 temples. After Alamelamma’s curse, Thalakadu gradually became covered by sand burying the ancient temples. Now the government is trying to excavate the ancient city to expose these temples.
2. The Kaveri river has been changing its course causing eroding of Malangi due to whirlpools. This has forced Malangi to keep relocating away from the river bank, adding different adjectives to its name and changing the name to Tadimalangi and the like.
3. *More than 400 years later, the Wadiyar dynasty has not had children* except in four instances. Two kings had sons who died as children. Once a king had a son who was born unable to speak. Later this son became the king and he had a son. Other than in these four instances, the kings who are born as princes have not had children. These kings have adopted male relatives as sons.

The adopted sons have later become kings. These kings have borne male children.

Hence, alternate generations of kings have borne children.

**RECENT HISTORY**

It is now more than 400 years since Alamelamma justifiably uttered the effective curse.

The titular king Srikantadatta Narasimharaja Wadiyar was a naturally born prince who became the king. He and his wife did not have children. They did not adopt a child. After his death on 10 Dec 2013, his wife, the titular queen Pramoda Devi, adopted an adult relative on 23 Feb 2015. On 28 May 2015, he became the current titular king, Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar, Maharaja of Mysuru. This king married a royal, Trishikha Kumari from the state of Rajasthan. They have a son, Aadyaveer Narasimharaja Wadiyar.

**CORRUPT INDIAN POLICE, CURRENT**

![](/assets/police.jpg)

Indian men get away with their crimes including multiple murder attempts. They heavily bribe the police. The police, upon receiving, from the woman victim, multiple complaints of attempted murder and innumerable other serious crimes, do absolutely nothing. **The more the woman complains to the police the more bribes the latter get from the criminals.  *The police are delighted, in fact overjoyed, to receive a phone call from and see the woman victim come to their police station when she complains of crimes. The police enjoy the crimes.***

[CORRUPT INDIAN JUDICIARY, CURRENT](http://www.gktemple.org/emanual.html)

![](/assets/justice.png)

**The case of Mari: The judiciary is no better.** Mari was a victim of several crimes including attempted murders and assault and robbery. Legally, through the court system, she regained possession of her robbed articles. After a long time, only this case of assault and robbery came to trial in court. Prior to the trial, Mari met the public prosecutor. Expecting a heavy bribe, he told her to come to his house. She did not do so. She met the Director of Prosecutions. Then the prosecutor of her case, after, not before, the trial started, did some work. Days prior to her departure to another country, the judge told her to leave her robbed articles in the court. She informed her brilliant and knowledgeable maternal grandmother, who, coming from a family of attorneys, responded, “Nothing doing!”

**INDIANS ATTITUDE, CURRENT**

**Centuries later, millions of Indian men and women still believe in male superiority, that women without a husband should possess nothing and that they should not even be alive. *The wives instigate the husbands. To them, openly, greedily, unethically, illegally, unjustly, and criminally stealing good and harmless women’s movable and immovable property is the norm.***

***Unjust people only understand not having children.*\
*Evil and unjust people force good people to take extreme measures as a last resort.***
