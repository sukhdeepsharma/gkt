The passage in Alfred Nobel's Will regarding the \[Nobel] Prizes was legally defective. Hence, it was almost impossible to implement the will. Alfred Nobel's favorite nephew, Emanuel, who lived in Russia, wanted Nobel's wishes to be respected. Emanuel told Ragnar Sohlman, executor of Nobel's will, about the Russian concept that the executor is "the spokesman of the soul" of the testator.

**Warren Buffet and Bill and Melinda Gates advise wealthy Indians to do philanthropy**

India is at the bottom of the list for philanthropy and at the top of the list for corruption. It is shameful that philanthropists from another country have to go to India to advise wealthy Indians to do philanthropy.

The following is based on the true story of a family of three wealthy brothers with professional degrees making multiple attempts to murder their only sister, Mari, a woman wanting to honor her good and charitable forebears and do charity. The brothers greedily grab her rightful share of multiple inherited properties. This is a story about one woman's bravery and struggle to help others despite being confronted with hatred and violence. This story addresses attitudes that are far too common in India and other parts of the world.

**Mari's Godly Grandparents and Father**

![Mari's Godly Grandparents and Father](/assets/emanualnobel004.jpg)

The grandparents' and father's property were earned honestly and worth hundreds of millions of Indian rupees. The father had a big beautiful house in the city and agricultural land in the suburbs; the paternal grandmother had paddy fields and a house in the village; the maternal grandparents had a big beautiful house in the city. They had gold, silver, money, etc. They believed in the principles of equality, charity and philanthropy, and that wealth should be shared with those less fortunate.

**Mari's Discriminating Mother**

Upon the death of Mari's father, the property had been transferred to the name of the mother. The mother favored her sons and denied her own daughter, Mari, her rightful share of the inherited property. The mother's belief was that the wealth should be given only to her sons and their families. She did not share her own parents', husband's and mother-in-law's views. She was raised by parents who had great love and respect for one another. The parents took excellent care of both sons and daughters, she included and raised their sons to respect their sisters.

Her husband believed in equality for women and education for all. Upon his sister dying at childbirth, he brought home her three little daughters who became members of his family. Her widowed mother-in-law annually sold her paddy and distributed the money among family members. The mother-in-law believing in equality for all women, divided her money equally, irrespective of gender, age and relationship, among her daughter-in-law, son's male and female children and deceased daughter's children, all female.

Despite the mother being taught about equal treatment for women, she adopted the prevalent culture of Indian society. This discriminatory culture costs society not only in humanitarian terms but has also cost India up to 4% of its economic growth.

**Mari's chauvinistic criminal brothers**

The three brothers believe that they are superior beings. They greedily want Mari's entire property for themselves. The mother is a puppet in the hands of her sons. She signs anything and everything they tell her to sign.

While Mari was away in another city pursuing higher education, the greedy brothers sold the\
father's agricultural land and greedily grabbed her rightful share of the property. Illegally they\
divided the land into plots for buildings and sold it for a great profit.

**Mari**

Mari, upon completing her education, returned home to her Father's house and commenced living in the partially constructed, vacant upper level of the house.

**Criminal brothers attempt to burn Mari with kerosene**

![]()

Very late at night, the brothers attempted to burn Mari with kerosene. They believed that this was their right because of their belief that being men, they were superior beings. The mother witnessed this horrible incident and did absolutely nothing.

However, Mari escaped. In the middle of the night, she went to the police station and informed the police of her brothers’ murder attempt. The police ultimately sent the case to the Magistrate's Court. The following day, Mari's mother informed Mari that the police had come to the house when the latter was not at home. The mother also told Mari angrily, that later, the neighbor across the street had enquired as to why the police had come to their house. She said to Mari accusingly, "This is what you did!" Thereafter she repeatedly told Mari to withdraw the case in court. Of course, Mari did not do so. Years later Mari was never contacted by the court about her case. Her criminal brothers were never punished for their crimes. There was no justice for Mari.

**Criminal brothers want Mari dead**

![Criminal brothers want Mari dead](/assets/emanualnobel008.jpg)

The criminal brothers attempt to stab Mari with a knife. They ceaselessly harassed Mari in innumerable ways such as urinating at her door step and cutting off her water supply. In the middle of the night, Mari had to carry water up the stairs from the back yard tap. Mari kept complaining to the police. The criminal brothers kept bribing the police who did nothing.

**Criminal brothers conspire with serial criminal who aided by her own female child assaults Mari. Criminal’s husband incessantly stalks Mari**

![Criminal brothers conspire with serial criminal who aided by her own female child assaults Mari. Criminal’s husband incessantly stalks Mari](/assets/emanualnobel009.jpg)

Criminal brothers conspire with a woman bank officer who had been dismissed for misappropriation. She was a serial criminal. With her female child as an aid, she had assaulted many people. She had become a TV personality.

Exactly a year after the attempted kerosene burning, upstairs where Mari was living, this woman serial criminal, aided by her daughter, assaulted her with a hammer and robbed her of her possessions. Downstairs was the brothers' household. Mari fought back and survived. When the assaulter left, Mari quietly followed her to the street. Students from an educational institution across the street were coming out for lunch break. They nabbed the attacker with her weapon and stolen goods and held her until the police arrived. The police sent the case to the Sessions Court. Thereafter, the serial criminal’s husband incessantly stalked Mari despite the latter complaining to the police. Years later the case had not been resolved in the court and there was again no justice for Mari.

**Criminal brothers conspire with Mari’s criminal martial arts instructor to have Mari killed**

Mari commenced learning martial arts for self-defense. The criminal brothers conspired with the martial arts instructor to have Mari killed. Mari survived the instructor's murder attempts but she had to quit learning martial arts.

The brothers sold their paternal grandmother's paddy fields and house and greedily grabbed Mari's rightful share of the property. Once again Mari was denied her birthright. With her share of the property, Mari had wanted to construct a school in the village in which there was no school.

The brothers continued to ceaselessly harass Mari.

**Criminal brothers send Mari's Horoscope to Astounding Astrologer**

![Criminal brothers send Mari's Horoscope to Astounding Astrologer](/assets/emanualnobel011.jpg)

The Brothers discovered that there lived in New Delhi an astounding astrologer. They sent him Mari's horoscope.

The astounding astrologer sent to the criminal brothers a\
report regarding Mari: "This is a woman to mind her own\
work. She is not one to bother anybody. It is the people\
around her who ought to be all right."

**Mari's dream to conduct scientific research**

![Mari's dream to conduct scientific research](/assets/airplane.jpg)

Mari's dream was to conduct scientific research. A scientifically advanced country needed her for such work. She traveled to that country to conduct research. She felt that she could do more for others by contributing her knowledge for the betterment of all people.

Mari hopes that her case can inspire other Indian women to demand equality in their lifetime.

**Mari's pursuit to honor forebears and fulfill their wishes by doing charity**

![](/assets/emanualnobel012.jpg)

Mari refused to be marginalized by her family or her culture. She was willing to tackle the issues that confront all people with philanthropy and concern for others. She was living out the advice given by Warren Buffett and Bill and Melinda Gates. Mari discovered an inspirational way for stating her thoughts regarding charity and philanthropy when she read Alfred Nobel's biography. Her belief is manifested in the words of Emanuel Nobel. In addressing these issues, she was addressing the greatest dangers not only for women but for people all over the world in the 21st century.

**Post Script**

The serial assaulter and her growing daughter attempted to murder multiple persons for years. Decades later, the mother was finally convicted and sentenced to only seven years rigorous imprisonment. After three years, while on parole because her mother died, she committed suicide.

The criminal now grown-up daughter was sentenced to ‘life imprisonment’ as defined by Indian law.

The duo made big news. In India, such criminals being convicted is obviously surprising considering that they attempted to murder multiple persons for years prior to being convicted.

***If the mother and daughter criminals had been convicted and imprisoned in Mari’s case it would have saved many other victims from their criminal activities such as attempted murder.***

The criminal greedy brothers kept for themselves the mother’s share of money obtained by selling Maternal Grandparents’ big house in a city. Mari’s maternal grandmother had kept saying that grandfather, in his home town at the confluence of rivers, had wanted to construct on the river bank, a building for people to perform the death anniversary ceremony. Mari had wanted to use the money to fulfill her Godly Grandfather’s wishes.

After the mother’s death, the criminal greedy brothers kept for themselves all of the mother’s money, gold, silver etc. Mari had wanted to use the money to fulfill the mother’s father’s \[Mari’s maternal Godly Grandfather’s] wishes.

**Thus, the wealthy, criminal, greedy brothers illegally sell Father's agricultural land and Paternal Grandmother’s agricultural land and house. They keep for themselves the mother’s share of money obtained by selling Maternal Grandparents’ big house. After the mother’s death, they keep for themselves the mother’s money, gold, silver etc. They greedily grab Mari's rightful share**

**Corrupt Indian Police**

![Police](/assets/police.jpg)

Indian men get away with their crimes including multiple murder attempts. They heavily bribe the police. The police, upon receiving, from the woman victim, multiple complaints of attempted murder and innumerable other serious crimes, do absolutely nothing. **The more the woman complains to the police the more bribes the latter get from the criminals.  *The police are delighted, in fact overjoyed, to receive a phone call from and see the woman victim come to their police station when she complains of crimes. The police enjoy the crimes.***

**Corrupt Indian Judiciary**

![](/assets/justice.png)

**Indian Judiciary is no better**. Legally, through the court system, Mari regained possession of her articles of which she was robbed when she was assaulted. After a long time, only this case of assault and robbery came to trial in court. Prior to the trial, Mari met the public prosecutor. Expecting a heavy bribe, he told her to come to his house. She did not do so. She met the Director of Prosecutions. Then the prosecutor of her case, *after, not before*, the trial started, did some work. Days prior to her departure to another country, the judge told her to leave her robbed articles in the court. She informed her brilliant and knowledgeable maternal grandmother, who, coming from a family of attorneys, responded, “Nothing doing!”

.

**Evil and unjust people force good people and even God to take extreme measures as a last resort.**

**Centuries later, millions of Indian men and women still believe in male superiority, that women without a husband should possess nothing and that they should not even be alive. *The wives instigate the husbands. To them, openly, greedily, unethically, illegally, unjustly and criminally stealing good and harmless women’s movable and immovable property is the norm.***
