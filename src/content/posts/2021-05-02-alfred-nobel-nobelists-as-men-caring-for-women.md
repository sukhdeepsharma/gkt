Illustration Sabrina Brooks

Alfred Nobel was a Chemist, Inventor, Awesome Administrator and **Social Reformer**. He spoke six languages - his native Swedish, Russian, French, English, German and Italian. **He had named one of his ships ‘Brahma’**.

In a draft of Alfred Nobel’s will the last words were **“the most worthy shall receive the prize … man or woman."**

In 1873, at the age of 40, wealthy Alfred Nobel moved to Paris. The French government harassed Nobel regarding his invention of ballistite forcing him to move out of Paris.

In 1891 when Alfred Nobel left Paris and moved to San Remo, Italy. He took with him only a few of his belongings which included the above portrait of his mother Andriette Nobel.

**Nobel was very much attached to his mother and visited her on her birthday.**

**Once Alfred Nobel sent money to his mother. She distributed the money among widows who were very happy.**

Alfred Nobel’s lab assistant, chemical engineer Ragnar Sohlman’s **Norwegian wife attended Nobel’s official meetings**. Ragnar Sohlman, along with engineer Rudolf Lilljequist, was also the executor of Nobel’s will. Sohlman was 26 yrs. younger to Alfred Nobel.

**If not for Ragnar Sohlman** \[1870-1948], **Nobel’s will would not have materialized. It would have been a piece of paper in a museum.** Nobel's assets were located in several countries. Sohlman and Lilljequist moved the assets to Sweden. French authorities would possibly obstruct the assets being taken out of France. From the banks in Paris, on a horse drawn carriage, they collected the shares, bonds and other documents. In crates, they shipped the documents by rail to Sweden as registered luggage!

Author of book, 'The legacy of Alfred Nobel: the story behind the Nobel prizes.' ***This book is written with great love and respect for his boss.***
